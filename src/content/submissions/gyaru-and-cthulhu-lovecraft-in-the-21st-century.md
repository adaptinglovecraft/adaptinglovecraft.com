title: Gyaru and Cthulhu, Lovecraft in the 21st century
hook: Myriad of gruesome worlds and harrowing galaxies sprung forth under the
  influence of the Man of Providence, birthed by the millions of artists he
  inspired. We shall now embark on a journey to the very frontier of that
  extended Lovecraft universe, exploring the peppy, bright neon-coloured ‘gag
  slice-of-life’ manga ‘Gyaru and Cthulhu’ by Japanese author Pontogotanda, as
  we follow 17-year-old high school girl Futaba on her way to become Japan’s
  most famous pop singer. You didn’t expect that now, did you?

The history of Japan’s infatuation with Lovecraft and his universe can be traced back to the early 1940’s with the first translation of ‘The Statement of Randolph Carter’, but the cult didn’t properly take off until the *Call of Cthulhu* board game was translated in 1986. It has since grown tremendously, with many of Japan’s most famous authors and mangaka proudly disclaiming the major influence of the Cthulhu mythos on their own work and aesthetic sensibility.

Most of the time, this influence translates seamlessly into horror, be it visual (Junji Ito’s mangas, the late Kentaro Miura and his deeply influential Berserk) or novelistic (Ken Asamatsu), sometimes into the more specific genre of dark fantasy in video games (Hidetaka Miyazaki’s Bloodbourne series and lately the masterpiece that is Elden Ring), but always keeping a direct link to the original sense of horror, madness, or unease so carefully crafted by Lovecraft. The work I am about to share here is representative of the ‘chibification’ of Cthulhu and Lovecraft’s work in popular Japanese culture, seemingly far removed from the authorial intent loosely attributed to H.P. Lovecraft, of instilling fear, cosmic dread, and horrified awe into the minds of his readers.

Any and every popular figure is bound to be depicted as small and cute in Japan (chibi stands for characters being drawn tiny and adorable), and the mind-corrupting, reality-bending Cthulhu is far from an exception. If anything, the contrast between the eldritch God, especially its popular -albeit reductive- colossal, tentacular representations, and a diminutive, squid-like chubby creature with large eyes and adorable demon wings, makes it all the more endearing (cf. figure below, look at this cutie munching on our world and destroying all that has ever been known and loved, who’s a good non-gendered eldritch entity?!).
