Concerning Fun is a regularly published series of essays that critically examines texts from a variety of
medial forms, with a focus on games. “Fun” serves as a metaphor for the qualities that are prescribed
to the forms through which culture manifests itself. In as much as fun is something that games
supposedly ought to be, to “concern” ourselves with it implies a commitment to challenging the
norms by which cultural production and reception are usually structured.
What has any of this to do with Lovecraft? “Lovecraftian” adaptation is a natural place to start this
endeavor for various reasons. Among genre-ascriptions, the “Lovecraftian” stands out as a
particularly plastic signifier. The term can refer to grand, coherent and supernatural story-worlds, to
horror, to the ominous Weird, to adventure, mystery and all things pulp, to reactionary politics
cloaked in imagery of the fantastic, all the way to cults and elder gods. Sometimes, the Lovecraftian
means a vaguely-specified but profound philosophical stance; sometimes it just means tentacles.
Lovecraft adaptation, both as a mode of cultural production as well as an interpretative mode of
reception, thus has to face the problem of what Lovecraft is being adapted in the first place. The
question of what makes Lovecraft Lovecraft functions analogously to the questions of what makes
games games, films films, or books books. Adaptation as a field of theoretical debate is where these
questions intersect, producing a host of productive tensions.
Concerning Fun will not stick to Lovecraft forever, but take him as an instructive problem that serves
as a starting point for the ongoing analysis of our preconceptions about media.
